# piecewiseLinearModel
This is a log for the development of the piece-wise linear model of our system

# 20180325
as stated in the other repo, this work would have its own repo and this is it

new to the field, much knowledge needed

ran MATLAB linmod() on the ADAMS control plant model and it actually worked

but the result was not what I was looking for

my current understanding of the command was to generate a state-space linear model

so, the state of the system should be clear

but I think there is a difference between MATLAB and ADAMS

the input of a MATLAB model is a sequence of numbers (or vectors) which doesn't have time stamps, meaning the time between two entries are not defined. the iput is not a "trajectory". there is no time information.

output = matlab_model(x, x_dot)

the input of an ADAMS model is a trajectory, a sequence of time and number pairs. the derivatives are calculated inside the model.

output = admas_model(x(t)); x_dot and x_dot_dot are calculated locally inside the function

this difference in the function interface is the current supposed problem I have

another thing could be that I choose the wrong I/Os, AGAIN!!!
